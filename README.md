### Project Summary
This application performs a financial analysis on a company utilizing historical financial market data in order to give its user to make well informed investment decisions.

### Code Overview
This project contains two jupyter notebooks:
1. `final_project_impl.ipynb` - Main notebook which includes the following:
    - Stock Prediction using Machine Learning - Utilizing financial data to predict the price of a stock. This implements python's machine learning libraries to execute the prediction. This implementation will also plot the graphs between actual/predicted/future 'close' price for comparison.
    - Exploritory Data Analysis - Displays information related to a company including it latest analyst recommendations, historical earnings, social media sentiment, and a recent history of a stock's price along with technical indicators.
2. `financial_data_preprocessor.ipynb` - Notebook used to gather financial data

### Dataset
The dataset used to perform the analysis is stored in csv files within the `data` directory. A copy is also available in Google Drive: [Access Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hgWRHwlC9thoPKd7-dRqEHTPGYv3LtUk?usp=sharing). It contains financial data for Comcast and other companies. We utilized [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/docs/api) as the source of our data. Which is collected from our `financial_data_preprocessor` jupyter notebook.
Below is a list of the data that we gathered:
  - __Candlestick Data:__ Daily candlestick data (OHLCV) for stocks.
    - `candlestick_data.csv`
  - __Technical Indicators Data:__ Contains technical indicators such as moving average and the bollinger bands with the candlestick data.
    - `technical_indicators.csv`
 - __Company Surprise Earnings:__ Historical quarterly earnings containing expected and actual earnings
   - `surprise_earnings.csv`
 - __Recommendation Trends:__ The latest analyst recommendation trends for a company.
   - `recommendation_trends.csv`
 - __Insider Sentiment:__ Insider sentiment for companies using the Monthly Share Purchase Ratio (MSPR).
   - `insider_sentiment.csv`
 - __Insider Transactions:__ Insider transactions data sourced from Form 3,4,5, SEDI and relevant companies' filings.
   - `insider_transactions.csv`
 - __Social Media Sentiment:__ Social sentiment for stocks on Reddit and Twitter.
   - `social_media_sentiment.csv`

### Project Results
The project results are available in the "Modeling and Prediction" section of the final_project_impl.ipynb project file.

### Limitations and Challenges:
 - Our historical data is limited due to using a free version of finnhub. Which limits our API calls to 60 a minute.
 - A challenge for the future would be to predict the stock price further in the future as well as when to buy or sell a stock

## Running the Application
1. `final_project_impl.ipynb`: this notebook will use the local CSV files to run the analysis


### Software Pre-requisites:
Install the following dependencies in the python environment.
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install finnhub-python
pip install seaborn
```

### Running with Visual Studio Code
1. Install or enable the Python and Jupyter extenstions
2. Open the `final_project_impl.ipynb` jupyter notebook
3. Press `Run All` Button

### Running with jupyter notebook server
1. Run the `jupyter notebook` command in terminal from `dsci-521-project` directory
2. The notebook should open in your browser.
3. From the browser run all cells

> To run from server, jupyter must be installed: `pip install -U jupyter`
